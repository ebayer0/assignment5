        <p>With great pride, we present top quality wines produced in the rocky vineyards of sun washed Herzegovina, where the lime stone, minerals, herbs and Mediterranean sun are infused into every drop. Wine making enjoys an ancient and proud tradition in this land between the mountains and sea.  Wines have been produced in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia since the times of ancient Illyria. In 2007 archeologists discovered two Illyrian ships in the marshlands of Hutovo Blato-Wildlife Refuge near the town of Mostar. Sunk more than 2500 years ago, loaded with amphorae filled with Illyrian wine destined for distant ports, this find conjures romantic images of ancient Mediterranean trade routes and shows just how deeply the wine making tradition is rooted here.  Wine production continued in this region after the Romans defeated the last ruller of Illyria, Queen Teuta, in 168 BC. The front gate of the Roman Fortress Mogorjelo, built by Augustus Oktavian in the third century near the town of Capljina, is decorated with motifs of grapes and wine goblets. Long after the Roman empire was divided between east and west, evidence of the local wine producing tradition can be found on Stećci, medieval tombstones scattered over Bosnian’s mountain tops, which are decorated with motifs of grapes and vines.  In the 19th century, Austro-Hungarians invested heavily in Herzegovina wine making. They planted new and re-invigorated old vineyards of Blatina, Zilavka, Bena, Posip, Vranac, Plavac, Malvazija and other native sorts to produce the finest wines for the Vienna Hapsburg court. ​Viticulture in this region continues today, with vintners creating top quality wines of both international sorts and excellent local varietals. These are wines that were once only produced for royal consumption, but now available to a broader audience. Wines of Illyria is proud to introduce this ancient tradition of wine making to modern Austrians and Americans. </p>
